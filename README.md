# CSC212-Project
## Main.cpp Compilation Instructions
- 1. Compile main.cpp, sp_matrix.cpp (e.g g++ main.cpp sp_matrix.cpp)
  2. Run the file with file names in command line arguments (e.g ./sp_matrix test.txt test_2.txt test_3.txt test_4.txt)
  3. each of the files is for a different reason (Files 1 & 2 are for addition and 3 & 4 are for multiplication)
  4. In the file there are multiple std::cin statements to break up the code. Use anything other than a space to get past these.
## Rec_main.cpp Compilation Instructions
- 1. Compile rec_main.cpp, sp_matrix.cpp (e.g g++ main.cpp sp_matrix.cpp)
  2. Run the file with mode and file name in command line arguments (e.g ./sp_matrix 1 test.txt)
  3. Modes are:
     - 1-Print out the data
     - 2-Find the Highest and Lowest Rated Shows
     - 3-Get recommendations based off a liked Show
     - 4-Output a Sparse Matrix to a csv
     - 5-Output a Dense Matrix to a csv
